        <h3>What's It All About?</h3>
        <p>This website is a sandbox for experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
        <p>The point of all of this is for me to play around with the languages I am learning, so that I can better understand them.  <br>  will start projects out of my own curiosity to experiment here. These might be questions, or they might be me working through solutions to issues I encounter.</p>
        <p>Thanks for checking in :)</p>
